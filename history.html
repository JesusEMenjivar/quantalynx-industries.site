                            <p>Quantalyx Industries was founded in Zurich, Switzerland by a team of robotics engineers and industrial automation specialists. Initially operating as a small robotics startup from a shared workspace, the founding team focused on developing proprietary sensor technology for manufacturing quality control. The company secured seed funding from the European Industrial Innovation Fund and established its first R&D laboratory.</p>
                            <p>During this foundational period, code-named <strong>Phase 1</strong>, the team developed the initial prototypes of what would become the Quantalyx Edge Sensor Platform. Early deployments were conducted at pilot manufacturing facilities in Bavaria and Northern Italy.</p>

                        <div class="timeline-content">
                            <p>After two years of intensive development, Quantalyx Industries launched the <strong>Quantalyx Edge Mesh</strong> - a distributed network of intelligent sensors and edge computing nodes designed specifically for factory environments. This marked the company's transition from a pure R&D operation to a commercial technology provider.</p>
                            <p>The same year, the company established its internal IT infrastructure, deploying intranet.quantalyx-industries.site for employee collaboration and devops.quantalyx-industries.site to manage continuous integration and deployment pipelines. The first version of the internal VPN gateway was deployed at vpn.quantalyx-industries.site to enable secure remote access for field engineers.</p>
                            <p>Series A funding of €12 million enabled rapid expansion, including the opening of the Munich EMEA Operations Center.</p>

                            <p>Quantalyx Industries launched its flagship <strong>Secure Manufacturing Cloud</strong> platform, providing customers with a centralized intelligence layer for industrial operations. The platform offered AI-driven optimization, predictive maintenance analytics, and comprehensive OT/IT integration capabilities.</p>
                            <p>To support customer access, the company deployed portal.quantalyx-industries.site as the primary client interface. Enterprise single sign-on was enabled through sso.quantalyx-industries.site, integrating with customer identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OAuth protocols.</p>
                            <p>This period marked the beginning of <strong>Project Helios</strong>, an internal initiative to develop next-generation machine learning models for anomaly detection in industrial control systems. The project laid the groundwork for the advanced predictive capabilities that would differentiate Quantalyx in the market.</p>

                            <p>Recognizing the growing threat landscape targeting industrial control systems, Quantalyx Industries established a dedicated <strong>Security Operations Center (SOC)</strong> with 24/7 monitoring capabilities. The SOC was designed to protect both Quantalyx infrastructure and customer deployments from cyber threats.</p>
                            <p><strong>Project Aegis</strong> was launched as a comprehensive initiative to enhance security across all Quantalyx platforms. This included implementation of zero-trust networking principles, advanced SIEM integration, and the development of specialized intrusion detection systems for OT environments. Internal staff access was consolidated through staff.quantalyx-industries.site, requiring multi-factor authentication for all personnel.</p>
                            <p>The global OT monitoring network was expanded with regional nodes in Singapore, Frankfurt, and Northern Virginia, providing low-latency security monitoring for customers across all major geographic regions. The SOC team expanded to 45 analysts, with specialized units for threat intelligence, incident response, and vulnerability management.</p>
